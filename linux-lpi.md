Question 24 of 25

Which of the following commands can be used to partition up a disk in preparation for installing the Linux operating system, or creating a disk for data storage?

admin
fdisk
format
mkfs
Answer

Incorrect

The correct answer is fdisk. The admin command is used to administer SCCS and is nothing to do with disk partitioning. The format command does not exist on linux. The mkfs command is used to create a filesystem after the partitions have been created.

## Commands

> pg
> nice
> renice

> man
man -k list 

> apropos list
> which echo
affiche la commande echo

> tee
The line above will take any output from the command and put a copy in file1 as well as sending it to the screen. This could be combined further by allowing the output to be further processed by another command. The tee command can be used any number of times in a pipeline like this.

Redirecting Standard Error (stderr) 2>

Whilst you may see all the output from a command on a single screen this is not all neccessarily coming from stdout. There is also another data stream called standard error which by default is directed to the same screen as stdout. This data stream is used to send messages regarding any error messages. The advantage of having errors as a separate stream is that even if you redirect stdout to a file you will instantly see any error messages on the screen.

If the command is running automatically without user interaction then there may not be any one to see messages put on the screen. The standard error data stream can therefore be redirected in a similar way to stdout by prefixing the redirect by the number 2 digit. In fact the stdout data stream should be prefixed by the number 1 digit however this is dropped to save typing. To redirect any error messages to an error.log file and the normal responses to a log file the following would be used.

command >log.file 2>error.log

sort file1 >/temp/tmp$$
mv /tmp/tmp$$ file1

The file ending in $$ will actually be created by the system with a unique number. This is useful for temporary files as it prevents you overwriting a temporary file in use by a different process.
